# About

Just some files related to refurbishing a Tektronix 2465B.  Open an
issue if the service manual ever goes offline.

## 3D Models

Measured with a 0.1Â±0.2mm accuracy digital Tacklife caliper (it is
terrible).  Designed to fit accuratly, but size may vary.  None have
been 3D printed yet.

- `./grayKnob.scad` is the small gray knobs
- `./grayShaft.scad` is the gray shaft behind some knobs
- `./whiteShaft.scad` is the bigger white shaft behind some knobs

## Cleaning

The front-panel components were brightened with a Retrobright
solution.  A generous amount of Oxiclean and warm water seems
sufficient.  Tried sunlight and peracetic acid, I recommend not doing
that.

Do not use solvents with the "Tektronix" metal label strip.  The
coating quickly gets removed.

## TODO

- [ ] Replace the BNC connectors
- [ ] Replace the electrolytic capacitors
- [ ] Replace the torx screws (all mine have been stripped)
- [ ] Restore the blue case to original color
- [ ] Test power supply voltage and ripple
- [ ] Calibrate
